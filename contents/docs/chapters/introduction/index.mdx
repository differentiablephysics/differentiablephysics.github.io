# What is Differentiable Physics? 

The heart of physics is the construction of mathematical theories which
accurately predict the behavior of real systems. If your background is
in machine learning, you might pause and ask, doesn't machine learning
also aim to achieve the same result? At a high level, the answer is yes.
The difference is that accepted models of physical reality are far more
predictive than traditional machine learning. Why is this the case? The
reason is invariants are much more tightly defined and controlled for
physical models than for machine learned models, which are often
designed for ease of optimization rather than for fidelity to physical
reality. The goal of this book is to help bridge the gap between
accurate causal models of reality and machine learning. Let's start by
making a definition of a physical theory.

In a mathematical sense, we can view a physical theory as a mathematical
object consisting of the following parts

1.  States $\mathcal\{S\}$: This is a mathematical space which contains
    different possible configurations of the system we are interested in
    modeling.

2.  Symmetries $\mathcal\{G\}$: A collection of symmetries which the
    system must satisfy. These could be properties such as rotational or
    translational invariances (or equivariances) which posit that
    certain properties of the physical system are unchanged (or change
    in a structured fashion) under these transformations. Each such
    symmetry is associated with an according conservation law for the
    system by Noether's theorem. For examples, one such conservation law
    could be that energy is known to be conserved by the system.

3.  Operators $\mathcal\{O\}$: A collection of functions which map states
    in $\mathcal\{S\}$ to other states in $\mathcal\{S\}$. The most
    important operator for a physical system is often the time-evolution
    operator which governs how the system changes over time.

4.  Parameters $\mathcal\{W\}$: The set of parameters which govern the
    physical system. These could for example be physical constants such
    as the gravitational constant $g$. We've chosen the evocative name
    $\mathcal\{W\}$ for this parameter set to remind you of weights since
    these parameters have to be \"learned\" from physical experiments.

5.  Domain of Applicability $\mathcal\{C\}$: Physical theories typically
    have constraints on when they are applied. We model the domain of
    applicability as a set of constraints $\mathcal\{C\}$.

6.  Hyperparameters $\mathcal\{HP\}$: A hyperparameter of a physical
    theory is parameter that appears in a constraint on the system state
    or system parameters. You can think of a hyperparameter as a
    parameter that controls parameters. For example, if mass $m$ is a
    parameter of a physical model, then there might be a hyperparameters
    $M_\{\textrm\{max\}\}$ which limits $m < M_\{\textrm\{max\}\}$

7.  Observables $\mathcal\{B\}$: An observable is a function that maps
    from state space $\mathcal\{S\}$ to some other mathematical space,
    typically $\mathcal\{R\}$. Think of an observable as a physical
    quantity you can measure by observing the evolution of the physical
    system over time.

Put together, we can view a physical theory as a data structure, a tuple
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\textrm\{PhysicalTheory\} = (\mathcal\{S\}, \mathcal\{G\}, \mathcal\{O\}, \mathcal\{W\}, \mathcal\{C\}, \mathcal\{HP\}, \mathcal\{B\})
\end\{aligned\}$$ which models an aspect of reality. An arbitrary physical
theory is unlikely to be predictive. Part of the art of physics is
constructing physical theories which are predictive of reality as we
know it. Over the course of this book, we introduce a variety of
techniques for constructing useful physical theories. Some techniques
will draw upon classical physics, while others will draw from machine
learning and the disciplines of type theory, and differentiable
programming.

Types are a technique originating in computer science and logic which
associate to each term in a program a descriptive type. When
constructing a physical theory, we will take care to specify the core
types that populate that physical theory. For example, here are a few
types we will see repeatedly in the book $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mathbb\{R\}^3, \mathbb\{R\}^\{1,3\} L^2(\mathbb\{R\}^3, \mathcal\{C\}), \mathcal\{B\}(\mathcal\{H\})
\end\{aligned\}$$ which respectively represent the types of three
dimensional space, Minkowski space, quantum wave functions in three
dimensions, and quantum observables. By identifying the core types in a
physical system, we can transform the system into a rich implementation
in a programming language with a suitably powerful type theory. Note
that by our earlier definition, a physical theory is itself a
composition type.

The last tool we will use to model physical systems is differentiable
programming. The last decade of machine learning research has revealed
that essentially arbitrarily sophisticated programs can be
differentiated by using the tools of automatic differentiation. As a
result, tools like differential equation solvers, and physical
integrators can be leveraged as parts of a machine learning model. By
leveraging the universal approximation capability of neural networks,
which allow neural representations to represent arbitrarily complex
functions, and combining with rich typed differentiable programs, we may
achieve new insights into physical reality.

Formally, a differentiable program is a computer program controlled by a
set of *parameters* which can be *differentiated* with respect to any of
its parameters. Let's introduce a simple example of a differentiable
program. We will write this program in pseudo-code similar to a
high-level language like Python.

    # Parameters
    $w_1$: $mathbb\{R\}$, $w_2$: $\mathbb\{R\}$
    def f(x: $\mathbb\{R\}$, y: $\mathbb\{R\}$) $\to$ $\mathbb\{R\}$:
      return $w_1$ * x + $w_2$ * y
    grad(f, $w_1$)

We have a function $f$ which accepts two arguments, $x$, and $y$ which
are both real numbers. We have two parameters $w_1$ and $w_2$. So far
this should look pretty similar to a regular program you've seen before,
with the difference that we can have variables that take values in
$\mathbb\{R\}$ (recall that $\mathbb\{R\}$ denotes the set of real numbers).
In programming languages, representing values in $\mathbb\{R\}$ isn't
typically possible since infinite decimal representations can't be
stored on a computer, but for mathematical simplicity it's quite
convenient to be able to manipulate real numbers.

There is one new operation we can do with differentiable programs that
we can't typically do with regular programs: take derivatives. That is,
the following operation is valid in a differentiable program.

    grad = $\nabla$(f, $w_1$)

In familiar mathematical notation this snippet of code computes
$\frac\{\partial f\}\{\partial w_1\}$. At this point you might be confused
as to why we've detoured from discussing physical theories to writing
simple computer programs. The connection here is that this little
differentiable program can be interpreted as a physical theorem. The
state space is given by tuples $$\begin\{aligned\}
(x, y) \in \mathbb\{R\}^2,
\end\{aligned\}$$ and we have defined parameters, hyperparameters and an
update rule `f`. The connection is a little forced, but emphasizes the
reverse bridge from programs back to physical theories:

1.  States $\mathcal\{S\}$: Since $x_1$ and $x_2$ are both real numbers,
    $\mathcal\{S\} = \mathbb\{R\}^2$.

2.  Symmetries $\mathcal\{G\}$: There are no symmetries
    $\mathcal\{G\} = \emptyset$

3.  Operators $\mathcal\{O\}$: There are no operators so
    $\mathcal\{O\} = \emptyset$.

4.  Parameters $\mathcal\{W\}$: We have two parameters $w_1$ and $w_2$
    which both take real values, so we have parameter space
    $\mathcal\{W\} = \{w_1, w_2\}$.

5.  Constraints $\mathcal\{C\}$: There are no constraints on the variables
    so $\mathcal\{C\} = \emptyset$.

6.  Hyperparameters $\mathcal\{HP\}$: We have no constraints so
    $\mathcal\{HP\} = \emptyset$

7.  Observables $\mathcal\{B\}$: The function $f$ defines an observable so
    $\mathcal\{B\} = \{f\}$

In the rest of this book, we will find it useful to have a compressed
table representation for the fields of a physical theory.
Table [\[phs:theory:toy\]]\{reference-type="ref"
reference="phs:theory:toy"\} compresses the listing above into the format
we will use throughout the book.

| Property | Definition |
|-------------|---------------|
| States | $\mathcal\{S\} = \mathbb\{R\}^2$ |
| Symmetries | $\mathcal\{G\}$ = &#123;&#125; |
| Operators | $\mathcal\{O\}$ = &#123;&#125; |
| Parameters | $\mathcal\{W\}$ = &#123;&#125; |
| Constraints | $\mathcal\{C\}$ =  &#123;&#125; |
| Hyperparameters | $\mathcal\{HP\}$ = &#123;&#125; |
| Observables | $\mathcal\{B\} = \{f\}$ |

Not all differentiable programs would make sense as physical theories,
but the mapping between differentiable programs and physical theories is
useful regardless since it emphasizes the computational nature of a
physical theory. Through the rest of this chapter and this book, we will
write down a variety of physical theories and show how to convert them
to differentiable programs.

This correspondence extends further. In fact, we assert that every
physical theory is expressible as a differentiable program.\
\
***The Differentiable Church-Turing Thesis:** Any physical system can be
effectively modeled as a differentiable program.*\
We will make no attempts to prove this statement formally, but the rest
of this book will attempt to prove by example by modeling a wide array
of physical theories with different differentiable programs. We will
note that the differentiable programs we introduce will at times have to
use sophisticated operations and may be challenging to model in a
standard programming language, but this is a question of engineering and
programming language design.

## Working with Physical Theories

Let's return to discussing physical theories at a more abstract level.
What would we like to do with physical theories in practice? As a
simplified model, we posit that there are a few main operations that are
interesting to perform with physical theories.

### Learning the Theory from Data

Suppose that we have a dataset of messy observations. When we learn the
theory, we mean that we find a set of parameter values for the
parameters in $mathcal\{W\}$ that enable the physical theory to
meaningfully recapitulate known facts. We write roughly

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\mathcal\{W\}^* &= \argmin_\{\mathcal\{W\}\} \mathcal\{L\}(\textrm\{PhysicalTheory\}, \mathcal\{D\})
\end\{aligned\}$$

Tools from differentiable programming such as automatic differentiation
make learning parameter values much easier since we can perform gradient
descent directly on a physical theory.

### Solving the Theory

What does it mean to solve a physical theory? Very broadly speaking, a
"solution\" to a physical theory is characterizing the trajectory any
initial set of states takes through state space. That is, we'd like to
know what the state of the physical system will be at all points in time
given the initial conditions of the system.

Traditionally, the solution of a physical theory meant solving the
equations defining the theory analytically. This can work well for
simple (and even not so simple) systems, but there's often an upper
limit to the amount of complexity that can be handled analytically. This
means for our system, we will have to extend this definition further.

Our definition of a solution to a physical theory is an algorithm that
efficiently computes the approximate state of the system at any point in
time given the initial conditions. Suppose that $\mathcal\{D\}$ is the
collection of available data (physical observations). Let $\mathcal\{L\}$
be the loss, a mathematical measure of the error in fitting the theory
to the data. Restated in the language we introduced above, we have a
problem of learning the update operator which minimizes the loss.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mathcal\{O\}^* &= \argmin_\{\mathcal\{O\}, \mathcal\{W\}\} \mathcal\{L\}(\textrm\{PhysicalTheory\}, \mathcal\{D\})
\end\{aligned\}$$

Differentiable physics provides a powerful collection of new tools to
facilitate approximate solution of dynamic systems, including new
families of techniques for high dimensional differential equation
solution such as operator learning.

### Taking a Measurement

In many cases when solving a physical system isn't feasible, it is still
possible to take *measurements* from the physical system. It might be
helpful to think of a measurement as computing a bulk property. We can
for example experimentally take a measurement of average temperature of
a body without solving a complete physical theory describing the motion
of all atoms in the system. In many cases, similar computational
measurements can be taken from physical theories. We state the problem
of simulating a measurement $B$ as

$$\begin\{aligned\}
B^* &= B\left (\argmin_\{\mathcal\{W\}\} \mathcal\{L\}(\textrm\{PhysicalTheory\}, \mathcal\{D\}) \right)
\end\{aligned\}$$

One of the most powerful tools for simulating measurements is learned
representations. Roughly stated, a representation is a function that
restructures the state space of a system $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \phi: \mathcal\{S\} \to \mathcal\{S\}'
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $\mathcal\{S\}'$ is called the representation space.
The choice of a rich representation space can make learning measurements
much easier since we can reduce the problem to finding some
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    B': \mathcal\{S\}' \to R
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $B'$ may have a much simpler mathematical
representation than $B$. Learned representations can be viewed as a
generalization of Fourier theory in which transformations $\phi$ can
have more complex than the Fourier transform which allow for easy
computation of certain system properties.

## Why Does Differentiable Physics Matter?

Improved differentiable physics could allow for systematic design of new
molecules and materials. Improved modeling of plasmas could lead to
accelerated design of a functional fusion reactor. Differentiable
cosmology models could help answer questions about the formation of the
universe, and improved protein-ligand binding physics models could help
accelerate the design of new medicine.

### Who is the Target Audience?

We anticipate that this book will be useful for beginning (and
experienced) scientists who are interested in learning a new set of
tools to understand the physical world. We provide in-depth introduction
to both the basics of machine learning and the basics of physics in
order to broaden the target audience.

We anticipate that advanced undergraduates, beginning graduate students,
and interested industry professionals might find this book useful. We
also encourage determined younger students to give this work a try, so
we've included a long appendix with needed mathematical foundations for
students to tackle as they build needed skills.

### Relationship with Geometric Deep Learning

Geometric deep learning has emerged over the last few years as a
proposed organizational framework for deep learning architectures. Deep
layers are viewed as transformations which preserve (perhaps
approximately) a symmetry of a system. For example, shift invariance
induces a convolutional networks. Time-warp invariance induces an LSTM.
The framework of geometric deep learning is both more and less general
than differentiable physics. Geometric deep learning can apply to
problems outside the purview of physics (for example to e-commerce
challenges of three dimensional inventory management), while
differentiable physics can study physical systems where there is no
apparent symmetry. Differentiable physics also places on emphasis on the
use of techniques from the theory of programming languages, such as
strong type theories. Despite these differences, both frameworks are
logically close to one another and we anticipate a rich interplay
between these sets of ideas.

### A Note on Mathematical Rigor

Physicists are traditionally not rigorous with their mathematics. Often,
a physicist's primary guiding intuition is their sense for how nature
behaves, and not how the equations behave. This flexible approaches
towards mathematical rigor has led to some amazing breakthroughs in both
physics and mathematics.

However, we cannot be as intuition driven as traditional physicists. Our
goal in this book is to teach techniques which can eventually be
implemented in a programming language. Programming requires precision,
and we can't be sloppy with what our symbols mean. At the same time,
excessive formalism is avoided when it doesn't lead to improved
algorithms. We'll try to walk a middle path in this chapter and in the
rest of the book of using the minimal amount of rigor which is needed to
be precise and clear about what our models are actually doing.

### Topics Covered

In the rest of this book, we'll teach you how to apply the powerful
tools of differentiable programming to applications in modern physics.
Our discussion will be both theoretical and mathematical as well as
pragmatic and practical. We will attempt to achieve a balance between
these two viewpoints by interleaving dense mathematical analyses with
down-to-earth and useful case studies. We hope that this blended
approach will enable readers from a variety of backgrounds to approach
the material in this book. Engineers and experimentalists may choose to
focus on case studies in a first pass, while theorists may be more
interested in the mathematical foundations we lay. We hope though that
our practical readers will grow to appreciate the power of our
mathematical techniques and that our theoretical readers will appreciate
how useful these new tools can be in the "real\" world.

Most of all, we hope that you find beauty and interest in this book.
Differentiable physics offers a new paradigm of looking at much of the
edifice of modern physics. We enjoyed ourselves as we wrote this book,
and we hope that you share our joy while working through this book
yourselves.
